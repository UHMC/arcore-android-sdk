# UHMC Augmented Reality Demo using AR CORE
#### Introduction
This project is an extension of Google's AR Core demo app with additional features requested by students enrolled in the ABIT program under Debasis Bhattacharya. This project will serve as a way for these students to market their business ideas using emerging augmented reality technology.
#### System Requirements
* Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL
* Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950U, SM-G950N, SM-G950F, SM-G950FD, SM-G950W, SM-G950U1)
#### Dependencies
The libraries are in included in the git tree, just import the project to Android Studio and run. 

#### Application usage / Workflow
1. Open the app and allow camera permissions.
2. Face the camera on a surface that you wish to place objects on.
3. When a surface is found, click anywhere on it and the menu will open.
4. If you wish to change the object's size, it can be done in the "Adjustments" tab, otherwise select the asset.
	1. Currently, the object size is determined by a scaling factor. So the object will increase in size in all directions based on this scale. 
	2. Scale needs to be changed before the object is placed.
5. Tap the surface wherever you wish to place the object. 
	1. Currently, the object will be placed facing the camera. Rotation is still a work in progress, but for now that can be bypassed by placing the object in whatever orientation the camera is facing.
